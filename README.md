# odin-recipes

This project is a website featuring my favorite recipes. I will be demonstrating my knowledge of: basic HTML syntax, as well as lists (unordered/ordered), pictures, and links. I will also practice keeping a pattern of 'atomic commits' to my Github repository.

At the end of the project I will write an updated 'self-reflection' here in the README document.
