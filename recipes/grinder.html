    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A grinder is a variety of submarine sandwich that is especially popular in New England. The sandwich features a long roll that resembles Italian bread, but the interior is chewier and the exterior is crustier.
        The roll is sliced through the middle and is filled with olive oil, sliced ham, turkey, salami, or prosciutto, provolone cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's believed that the sandwich got its name after the fact that people have to grind their teeth while chewing the crusty bread.
